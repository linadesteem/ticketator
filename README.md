# Ticketator

Ticketator is a simple ticketing system developed in Python 2, based on Django Framework.
It's inspired in some Jira features and others ticketing systems commonly used by IT Departments.

Ticketator is about tickets, queues, users and groups.

You can find more screenshots [screenshot here]

### Some cool features

* Simple ticket creation
* Queues to organize tickets
* Rights to organize access to queues (based on group access, can comment, can edit, can view...)
* Comments on tickets
* Ability to define percentage made on a particular task
* Microtask related to a main taks (and percentage overall obtained from all microtask progress)
* Multiple users and groups
* HTML responsible design
* Dashboard with important info as open & pending tickets & RSS feed
* Only a few AJAX calls, not a Javascript/Jquery monster

Start to use Ticketator is as simple as install it, load initial data, create a superuser, a queue, and you're ready to create tickets!
